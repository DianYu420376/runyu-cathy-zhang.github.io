Welcome to my website! I am Runyu (Cathy) Zhang, and I am a [Postdoc for Engineering Excellence](https://engineering.mit.edu/the-mit-postdoctoral-fellowship-program-for-engineering-excellence/) at MIT and I'm working with [Prof. Asu Ozdaglar](https://asu.mit.edu/) and [Prof. Gioele Zardini](https://zardini.mit.edu/people/prof-gioele-zardini/). I earned my Ph.D. degree at Harvard University, School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, under the supervision of [Prof. Na Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/). Prior to pursuing Ph.D., I earned a B.S. degree in Scientific and Engineering Computing in the Mathematics department at Peking University in 2019. 

My research interest lies in learning, control and decision making in multi-agent systems. The high-level objective is to design scalable, efficient and provable learning/control algorithms for multi-agent systems under challenges such as communication constraints, strategic behavior and model uncertainty. My research sits at the intersection of various domains, utilizing tools from reinforcement learning (RL), game theory, control theory and optimization. As an ultimate goal, my research is dedicated to providing both theoretical insights and engineering tools for AI-enabled multi-agent societal systems design and operation.
